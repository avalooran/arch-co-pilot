        message: `Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field with a lot of potential. It has the ability to transform industries, solve complex problems, and enhance our daily lives in countless ways. From improving healthcare and optimizing logistics to advancing scientific research and enabling new forms of creativity, AI is making a significant impact.

However, there are also important considerations and challenges. Issues like data privacy, ethical use, and the potential for job displacement need to be carefully managed. It’s crucial that as AI continues to develop, we ensure that it’s used responsibly and equitably, with attention to the societal implications.

Overall, AI is a powerful tool, and its future will depend on how we choose to guide and regulate its development and application.`,

export const chatResponseFromBot = `ChatGPT is an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. It’s designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. Here’s a bit more about how it works and what it’s used for:

Training: ChatGPT is trained on a diverse range of text from the internet. This training helps it understand language patterns, context, and a wide array of topics.

Capabilities: It can answer questions, provide explanations, generate creative writing, assist with problem-solving, and engage in conversations on various topics.

Applications: It’s used in chatbots, virtual assistants, customer support, educational tools, and more. It helps with tasks like drafting emails, brainstorming ideas, and learning new concepts.

Limitations: While it’s quite powerful, it’s not perfect. It may occasionally produce incorrect or nonsensical answers and lacks personal experiences or emotions. Its responses are based on patterns in the data it was trained on rather than personal knowledge or understanding.

Overall, ChatGPT is designed to be a versatile and helpful tool for interacting with language and information.`;
